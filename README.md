# Binary Data Partitioning for Colorectal Cancer Detection with PyTorch
_Project for honors research class in my senior year of high school_

I was always passionate about CS, but in 2024 I knew that I also wanted to know more about the interdisciplinary opportunities of the subject. In my Honors Research class under the supervision of my CS instructor, I was introduced to this open-source [PyTorch project](https://github.com/xiey1/Colorectal_Histology_MNIST). The project utilizes the PyTorch model to detect colorectal cancer from Kather's [Colorectal Histology MNIST dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kmader/colorectal-histology-mnist). The model was originally trained with a multiclass dataset (histopathological images separated into tumor, stroma, etc), so for this project I modified it to binary classification (cancerous vs non cancerous) with the goal of comparing the accuracies of binary and multiclass classification.

I presented this project with the following posters at my schoolâ€™s Celebration of Innovation: a STEM symposium featuring over 50 researchers and more than 400 attendees. While my research partner Eloise S focused on references and figure explanations, I performed model modifications, generated the training/results graphs, and wrote the discussion.

Note: Generative AI was used to assist with both coding and documentation in this project. All AI-generated code was reviewed and tested before analysis. Analysis decisions and results reflect my own work.
